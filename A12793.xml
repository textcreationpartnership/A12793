            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>But to returne to the Salt you had from a Kings Store-houſe, touching the diligent ſtanding before Kings: know yee that it is not ſo to be vnderſtood, as though none were

                     <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> on the <hi>Iudges</hi> ſaith there are three kindes of faith found, for there is a faith which conſiſteth of humaine opinion &amp; perſwaſion, whereby thoſe things which are written in holy Scriptures are beléeued to be no leſſe true, then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Hiſtories of <hi>Liui, Suetonius,</hi> and thoſe things which are written, of the new Iſlands. This kind of faith, as touching many things, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:18358:99"/>to the Turks and Iewes: There is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother faith, whereby we being ſtirred vp, by the heauenly inſpiration, doe liuely and with efficacy cleaue to the promiſe of the mercy of God, by this faith certainely is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained iuſtification. The third faith is called the faith of miracles, whereby wee are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther changed nor made the better by a haire, for as much as it is the mouing of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, werewith men are ſtirred vp, to deſire miracles, vtterly beléeuing that it is the will of God, they ſhould be done, and that which is required ſhould haue ſucceſſe, wherefore whilſt they leane vnto this faith, ſometimes they obtaine that which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, which I therefore ſpeake, becauſe not alwaies they do ſo, neither are they alwaies illuſtrate with that inſpiration.</p>
                  <p>If ſo bee thou will demande (ſaith hee) how this kind of faith can bee proued, let <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> anſwere, which vpon the <hi>17.</hi> of <hi>Matthew</hi> maketh mention of it, There Chriſt ſaith: <hi>If you haue faith ſo much as is a graine of muſtard-ſeed, you ſhall ſay to this mountaine, throw thy ſelfe into the ſea, and it ſhall do it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In expounding theſe words, this Father ſaith, becauſe at this day theſe things are not done in the Church, ſhall we therefore
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:18358:100"/>ſay that Chriſtians are deſtitute of faith, God-forbid that we ſhould iudge ſo euill of the people of God, the faith which iuſtifieth is preſent, but that which is called the faith of miracles hath now ceaſed.

                  <p>Firſt, I finde that ancient Chriſtians being godly men, and great Clearks, did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the vſe of it in Baptiſme.</p>

                  <p>The third cauſe is, I ſée there bee many of the ſuperſtitious Catholikes (for I will kéepe the name of the ſincerer Catholickes, vnto our ſelues) ſo addicted to ſhewes and ſignes (though they ſay, wee féede on bare ſignes) that they bee ready to iudge all ſuch as croſſe not, enemies to the Croſſe of Chriſt: and therefore, for my part, I chooſe rather to vſe it, (the higher powers that command it, not attributing ſuch power vnto it as our Aduerſaries doe) then to giue any occaſion to the Recuſants to ſay the Gouernours would haue vs come to Church, and when we come there, wee ſhall ſée ſuch as ſhould exhort vs to obey in matters of ſubſtance, vnwilling to yeelde to ſuch things as themſelues call

But all that liued here in time of Popery, or haue trauelled where ſuch Images be much regarded, muſt needes confeſſe, that they haue beene, and are made very Idols, and that a number goe a whooring after them, as the Heathen did after theirs. They that tare the Church bookes heere, and ſaid, Vp ſhall holy Croſſe, and you ſhall goe downe, were not farre from this. But howſoeuer other places of holy Scripture touching Images may bee vnderſtood of heathen mens idols, I can hardly be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in the place I cited before, meant ſuch only, becauſe he wrote to ſuch Fathers as knew him that was from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, &amp; to ſuch yong men as were ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g and had the word of God abiding in them, and knew the truth.

                  <p>There be diuers meanes, which if they be rightly vſed, will no doubt further vs well in that ſearch.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is Prayer; <hi>Aſke, and it ſhall be giuen you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond is the knowledg of the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall tongues, chiefely required in tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors: for except we vnderſtand the words, how ſhall we find the ſence?</p>
                  <p>The third is the Word, to conſider what is ſpoken properly, what figuratiuely.<note place="margin">VVhit contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. l. p <hi>349. 350. 351.</hi> &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>It is a miſerable bondage of the Soule</hi> (ſayth <hi>Auſtin,</hi>) <hi>to take the Signes for the Things:</hi> That is, to interpret thoſe things properly, that are ſpoken figuratiuely.</p>
                  <p>The fourth is to conſider the ſcope, the end, the matter, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> circumſtance, what went before, and what followeth after.</p>
                  <p>If thou wilt enter into life (ſaith Chriſt) keepe the Commandements: Here-hence our Aduerſaries do gather, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we are iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by works, not marking to what man our Sauiour Chriſt made that anſwere; euen to him verily, which leaning to the opinion of his owne righteouſnes, demaunded what thinges he might doe that he might obtaine
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:18358:171"/>eternall life, ſuch men as truſt to their own workes, are worthily ſent to the Law, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſo they may vnderſtand, how farre they bee from perfect righteouſneſſe.</p>
                  <p>The fift meane is, to conferre one place with another, the obſcure with ſuch as bee more plaine: Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, <hi>Abraham</hi> was iuſtified by workes:<note place="margin">Ia. 2.21.</note> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Abraham</hi> was not iuſtified by workes, for then he ſhould haue wherein to boaſt:<note place="margin">Rom. 4.2.</note> And that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake in that place of workes which followed the calling of <hi>Abraham,</hi> it is euident firſt becauſe it is ſaid; <hi>Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued God, and it was imputed to him for righteouſneſſe:</hi> which all men know to haue bene long after his calling: Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Saint <hi>Paul</hi> commeth afterward to the example of <hi>Dauid,</hi> who was an holy man, renued by the Spirit of God &amp; called of God. Wee muſt needs therefore grant, that the word of Iuſtification is taken di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſly. So that to be iuſtified with <hi>Iames,</hi> is to bee declared iuſt, as <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> himſelfe vpon that place granteth, but to be iuſtified with <hi>Paul,</hi> is to bee abſolued from all ſinnes, and to be reputed iuſt.</p>

                     <hi>There be ſome which thinke that Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſpake of iuſtification, as it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth ſanctification: but go on.</hi>

                  <p>The ſixt meane is not onely to conferre like places with like, but alſo vnlike with vnlike. <hi>Except ye eate the fleſh of the Sonne of man, and drinke his bloud, you haue no life in you:</hi> let this place be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the like, in the fourth of <hi>Iohn: Whoſoeuer ſhall drinke of that water which I ſhall giue vnto him, there ſhall bee in him a ſpring of water, ryſing vp vnto life eternall.</hi> This water is ſpirituall,<note place="margin">Eademratie.</note> and the manner of drinking of it is Spirituall: And there is the ſame manner of eating his fleſh: for to eate and drinke are alike. Therforeas that water is drunke after a Spirituall manner, which maketh that wee neuer thirſt: euen ſo ought the fleſh of Chriſt to be eaten, and his bloud drunke, but Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually: Now for vnlike places, compare that former place, <hi>Except yee eate the fleſh of the Sonne of man, &amp;c.</hi> with the ſixt commandement, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill,</hi> for if it be a wicked deed to kil a man, much more to eate and deuoure. Therefore Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, that thoſe words, <hi>Except yee eate the fleſh,</hi>

                  <p>The ſeuenth helpe for the vnderſtanding
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:18358:172"/>the darke places, is, to haue a care that all our expoſitions agree to the Analogy of our faith. By Analogy is meant a conſtant and perpetuall ſentence of the Scriptures in thoſe places, which are plaine and eaſy, ſuch as are the Articles of our faith, and ſuch things as are contained in the Lords pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the ten Commandements: ſo that whatſoeuer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ppoſition agreeth not with this Analogy is falſ. For examples ſake, our Aduerſaries out of the words of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, <hi>This is my body,</hi> picke a <hi>Tranſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Secondly, the Analogy of faith teacheth, that Chriſt is in heauen, therefore he is not in the bread, or with the bread. Thirdly y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Analogy of faith teacheth that Chriſt ſhal come from heauen to iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not out of a boxe.</p>
                  <p>The eighth meanes is, when we féele not ourſelues ſkilfull euough to vſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meanes,

                  <p>In the yeare of our Lord God, <hi>1581.</hi> on the fourteenth of October, there was a Gloceſterſhire Gentleman examined
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:18358:180"/>in the Towne-Hall of North-hampton.<note place="margin">M.

                  <p>Being therefore queſtioned withall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this matter, he anſwered: Indéede I am betrothed vnto her, and I thinke that I may lawfully marry her, though ſhee whom heretofore I tooke to wife bee yet liuing. The reaſon is, for that ſhee (I meane which was my firſt wife) was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time my Fathers Harlot, by whom hee had three Children, and after that did enforce mee, beeing foure and twentie yeeres of age, to marry her, to the end I might be partaker of that which hee was minded to beſtowe vpon her: that ſo hee might ſtoppe two gappes with one buſh. So I marryed her, and after I had two Children by her, I was diuorced from her in Biſhop <hi>Hoopers</hi> time: for the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers ſaid, it was not <hi>Matrimonium ab initio.</hi>
